# Computing Resources

This page contains some resources for R and Python. We will be using R
to perform data analysis in the class, however, you are welcome to use
any other tool/programming language you are familiar with.

We strongly encourage you to get familiar with the basics of R, so
that you can focus on machine learning.  We will go through examples
in R in-class and we will provide some instructions.  We do not expect
you to have taken a class that uses R previously. That said, this
class is not a class on R.

## R Resources 

- [Rob's notes on R](http://www.rob-mcculloch.org/2015_exec_data_mining/Simple-R-Introduction.pdf)
- [R's Introduction to R](http://www.rob-mcculloch.org/2015_exec_data_mining/R-intro.pdf) This is written by stat/computing geeks for stat/computing geeks. It is not always the easiest thing to read. That being said, if you want to learn R, you should read at least the first bit of the chapter on major topics (e.g. data frames). 
- The optional textbook *An introduction to statistical learning* has a section 2.3 dedicated to basics of R
- [Reference card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)
- [Google Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP)
- [Princeton Tutorail](http://data.princeton.edu/R)
- [R Markdown](Computing/R Markdown Tutorial.md) Vinh's R Markdown tutorial
- [R data.table](Computing/R data.table Tutorial.md) Vinh's R data.table tutorial
- Google and question answering web-page [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/)
- There are many books and tutorials on R. If you find something that you find particularly useful, share it with us on piazza.
