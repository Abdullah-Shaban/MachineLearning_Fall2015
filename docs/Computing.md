# **Computing Resources**

This page contains links to software installation guides and some resources for R and Python.


## R Resources 

We will be using R to perform data analysis in the class, however, you are welcome to use
any other tool/programming language you are familiar with.

We strongly encourage you to get familiar with the basics of R, so that you can focus on Machine Learning.
We will go through examples in R in-class and we will provide some instructions. We do not expect
you to have taken a class that uses R previously. That said, this class is not a class on R.

- [**R's Introduction to R**](http://www.rob-mcculloch.org/2015_exec_data_mining/R-intro.pdf):
This is written by stat/computing geeks for stat/computing geeks. It is not always the easiest thing to read.
That being said, if you want to learn R, you should read at least the first bit of the chapter on major topics (e.g. data frames).
- The optional textbook ***An Introduction to Statistical Learning*** has a section 2.3 dedicated to the basics of R
