# **Final Project**

Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting Machine Learning problem of your choice
in the context of a real-world data set. Your class project must be about new things you have done this semester;
you can't use results you have developed in previous semesters.
We will provide some project ideas here, but the best idea
is to combine Machine Learning with a problem in your business area.

**Deadlines:**

  - _Project Proposal:_ Week 7
  - _Project Write-up:_ Week 11


## Project Proposal 

Proposals should be one page maximum.

Include the following information: 

  - _Project Title_
  - _Data Set_
  - _Project Idea._ Describe what you want to achieve. What Machine Learning tools are you going to use?
  How is the data set going to help you answer your question?
