# Project

Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting
machine learning problem of your choice in the context of a real-world
data set. Your class project must be about new things you have done
this semester; you can't use results you have developed in previous
semesters. We will provide some project ideas here, but the best idea
is to combine machine learning with a problem in your area.

**Deadlines:**

  - Project Proposal: week 7
  - Project Write-up: week 11


### Project Proposal 

Proposals should be one page maximum.

Include the following information: 

  - Project title 
  - Data set 
  - Project idea. Describe what you want to achive. What machine learning tools are you going to use? How is the data set going to help you answer your question?
