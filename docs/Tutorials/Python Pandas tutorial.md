# **Pandas** tutorial

**`pandas`** is the data frame solution in Python, very much like R's `data.frame` and `data.table`.

To understand `pandas` through a demo example:

- Launch your command-line terminal
- In the command-line terminal, launch iPython Notebook by the command **`ipython notebook`**;
that will bring up a **Jupyter** web browser window at address `localhost:8888/tree`
- In the Jupyter browser windows, navigate to the **_[Your Course Repository Folder]_/docs/Tutorials/** folder
and open the "**Python Pandas tutorial.ipynb**" notebook, which gives a demo on key features / functionalities
of `pandas` data frames
