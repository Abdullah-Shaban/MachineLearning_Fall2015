# **iPython Notebook** tutorial

iPython Notebook is an interactive scientific computing environment built on Python.
It enables us to create documents combining text for reporting / story-telling and Python code for data analysis.

An iPython notebook can be run to render a beautiful report in its native _\*.ipynb_ format itself.
If necessary, notebooks can also be converted to other publication formats such as HTML and PDF

- _**note**: at the point of writing of this tutorial, conversion to the PDF format is not mature and done in a rather
complex manner through LaTeX document interpreters._

To understand iPython Notebook through a demo example:

- Launch your command-line terminal
- In the command-line terminal, launch iPython Notebook by the command **`ipython notebook`**;
that will bring up a **Jupyter** web browser window at address `localhost:8888/tree`
- In the Jupyter browser windows, navigate to the **_[Your Course Repository Folder]_/docs/Tutorials/** folder
and open the "**Python iPython Notebook tutorial.ipynb**" notebook
- Inspect each "cell" (section in a rectagular box) of the notebook by **double-clicking to see the source code**,
and **running the cell by the key combination Ctrl + Enter**
