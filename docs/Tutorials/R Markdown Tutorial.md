# **R Markdown** Tutorial

R Markdown is a text file format that combines:

- R code for data analysis, and
- text for telling a story / writing a report on your analysis

Think of R Markdown as a way for you to write up your project report and code up your math at the same time, in the same place.

This tutorial provides an example script to illustrate how to use R Markdown. Please go through the following steps:

- Download this [**R Markdown (.Rmd) script**](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChicagoBoothML/MachineLearning_Fall2015/master/docs/Tutorials/R%20Markdown%20Tutorial.Rmd) onto your local disk drive
- Open the downloaded R Markdown script in RStudio
- Make sure the `rmarkdown` package is installed in R. If not, run the command **`install.packages('rmarkdown')`** in RStudio
- In the text-editing window in RStudio, just below the file name, find and press the "**Knit PDF**" button, which will read the content of the script and convert it to a PDF document in the same folder as your R Markdown script file
- Inspect the R Markdown script file thoroughly and look at the PDF output to see how the *.Rmd* input is rendered in the final output
