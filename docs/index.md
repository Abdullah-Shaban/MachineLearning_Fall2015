# **Machine Learning** (41204) @ Chicago Booth

If you are visiting this site in Fall 2015, we predict with >90% confidence (and 110% excitement! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>) that you're among the Booth students who, together with us, are making some nice history. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

This inaugural Machine Learning course specially tailored for MBAs is the **VERY FIRST OF ITS KIND in any curricula of the leading U.S. and international business schools** that we know of.

Advanced Machine Learning is the very core of modern Data Analytics, which companies big and small are leveraging to mine commercial value out of their increasingly vast troves of information.

This course aims to give you a 10-week tasting session on a diverse buffet of popular, powerful and highly practical Machine Learning algorithms, with the hope that what you take away here will help you rise up to data-enabled commercial opportunities in your later careers.

The main programming language for this course is **R** *(which we are proposing to our Deans to be a strict Booth admission prerequisite in addition to GMAT from 2016-2017...)*. In addition, a major innovation in this course is an option for you to do programming in **Python** if you so choose. That's double work for us, but hopefully more than double joy to you. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

Enjoy!

***P.S.**: For this very first offering, we ask for your cooperation and patience if Murphy's Law ever turns active.*


# IMPORTANT: Course Materials Repository on GitHub.com

All of our course materials will be published through a this [**repository on GitHub.com**](http://github.com/ChicagoBoothML/MachineLearning_Fall2015).

* That means our UChicago Chalk site will be as quite as an autumn lake - it may only have your grades; for everything else, go to this repo.

The very first thing you should do is to follow to these [**Git, GitHub and SourceTree installation guides**](Installation/Git, GitHub & SourceTree.md) to install the necessary Git-related software, and then **clone** this online repo onto a folder on your machine's hard drive.

* We will hitherto refer to that cloned folder "***[Your Course Repository Folder]***"

Git is version-control software that is analogous to *"Track Changes"* in your familiar Word Documents. It monitors all changes and updates throughout the life of a repository (i.e., group) of files and folders, and in doing so help multiple people synchronize the contents of the same set of materials.

The ***SourceTree*** app has a simple *"Pull"* button for you to obtain any changes / updates / additions we make to the course materials. After each pull, you have 100% of whatever we have. No more sweat shed on manually downloading slides / files from Chalk.
