### Course summary

If you are visiting this site in Fall 2015, we predict with >90%
confidence (and 110% excitement!) that you're among the Booth students
who, together with us, are making some nice history.
This inaugural Machine Learning course specially tailored for MBAs is
the VERY FIRST OF ITS KIND in any curricula of the leading U.S. and
international business schools that we know of.

Machine Learning is the very core of modern Data Analytics, which
companies big and small are leveraging to mine commercial value out of
their increasingly vast troves of information.
This course aims to give you a 10-week tasting session on a diverse
buffet of popular, powerful and highly practical Machine Learning
algorithms, with the hope that what you take away here will help you
rise up to data-enabled commercial opportunities in your later
careers.

Students will learn about state-of-the-art machine learning techniques
and how to apply them in business related problems. Techniques will be
introduced in the context of business applications and the emphasis
will be put on how machine learning can be used to create value and
provide insights from data.

First, and the biggest, part of the class will focus on predictive
analytics. Students will learn about decision trees, nearest neighbor
classifiers, boosting, random forests, deep neural networks, naive
Bayes and support vector machines. Among other examples, we will apply
these techniques to detecting spam in email, click-through rate
prediction in online advertisement, image classification, face
recognition, sentiment analysis and churn prediction. Students will
learn what techniques to apply and why.

In the second part of the class, students will learn about
unsupervised techniques for extracting actionable patterns from
data. Examples include clustering, collaborative filtering,
probabilistic graphical modeling and dimension reduction with
applications to customer segmentation, recommender systems, graph and
time series mining, and anomaly detection.

### Discussion forum

We will be using
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/fall2015/bus41204/home) for
class discussion. Please post any questions that you may have there,
rather than emailing TAs or instructors. All your classmates will
benefit from the public discussion.

We also encourage you to answer other students' questions. Answering
question will reinforce your learning and understanding of the
material. We will carefully check all discussions and clarify any
confusion.

If we answer your questions after 2am, consider sending a rose...

### Prerequisites 

The class does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge nor
extensive programming experience. However, the nature of the material
is somewhat technical.

BUS 41000 or BUS 41100. You should be familiar with basic probability
  and linear regression. If you have not taken either of these
  courses, you can still take Machine Learning if you have
  quantitative background. However, in case there are gaps in your
  background, we will expect that you fill those gaps as soon as
  possible, or withdraw from the course otherwise.

Addition, you should be familiar with R, a platform for statistical
analysis.


### Computing

All computing in class will be conducted in R. The focus of the class
will be on teaching machine learning concepts rather than how to use
R. Some resources for learning R are provided [here](..).

_Other programming languages._ There are many programming languages
that have readily available machine learning libraries. You are free
to use any of them in your homeworks and projects. However, if you
choose to do so, we may not be able to provide much support. In
addition to R, thanks to Vinh, we will provide some help with Python. 

### Textbooks

There are no required textbooks. All materials notes will be available on the class website. 

_Optional textbooks:_ Books below do not cover all the material we plan to cover in the class. We list both technical books and business related books.

**[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)**  <br/>
*Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani* <br/>
This book provides a great introduction to the of learning. Concepts are well explained, without too much technical details. <br/>
_PDF available online_

**[Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)**  <br/>
*Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman* <br/>
This book covers similar material to the one above, however, it provides more technical material. <br/>
_PDF available online_

**[Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/)**  <br/>
*Kevin Murphy* <br/>
PhD level book. The book provides encyclopedic survey of the area.

The following two books are very light on technical details, but do talk applying machine learning in the context of business applications.

**[Data Science for Business](http://data-science-for-biz.com/)** <br/>
*Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett*<br/>

**[Big Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning: Value Creation for Business Leaders and Practitioners](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1502462915)**
*Jared Dean*

### Grading

Homework assignments (**30%**), Midterm (**30%**), Final project (**40%**)

There will be **8 homework assignments** that will be due weekly
except week 1 and 6. These assignments can be done in groups (max size
4). Students should submit only one write-up per group. Homework
should be submitted through Chalk.

There is a **take-home midterm** that will be posted in week 5 and
will be due in week 6. Students must work individually on the midterm.

The **final project** can be done in a group. The goal will be to
apply machine learning to a particular business problem. More details
about the project can be found [here](Project).
