# Computer Operating System Requirements

In the following installation guides, we assume that your machine runs on either **Mac** or **Windows**.

If you happen to use Linux or another operating system, certain setups can get hairier and there may be a need to consult
[***Dr. Google***](http://www.google.com) and [***Prof. Stack Overflow***](http://www.stackoverflow.com) heavily.

You may contact our kind-hearted Teaching Assistants for individualized assistance, although there is no guarantee we can solve non-Mac, non-Windows problems...
