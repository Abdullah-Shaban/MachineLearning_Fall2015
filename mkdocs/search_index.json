You will learn what techniques to apply and why.\n\n\nIn the second part of the class, you will learn about \nUnsupervised Learning\n techniques for\nextracting actionable patterns from data. Examples include Clustering, Collaborative Filtering,\nProbabilistic Graphical Models and Dimensionality Reduction with applications to customer segmentation,\nrecommender systems, graph and time series mining, and anomaly detection.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nThis course does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge nor extensive programming experience.\nHowever, the nature of the material is somewhat technical.\n\n\nBUS 41000\n (\nBusiness Statistics\n) or \nBUS 41100\n (\nApplied Regression\n) is highly recommended.\nYou should be familiar with basic Probability and Linear Regression. If you have taken neither of these courses,\nyou can still take Machine Learning if you have a strong quantitative background.\nHowever, in case there are gaps in your background, we expect that you fill those gaps as soon as possible,\nor withdraw from the course otherwise.\n\n\nAddition, you should be familiar with \nprogramming in R\n, a platform for statistical analysis.\n\n\nComputing\n\n\nAll computing in class will be conducted in R.\nThe focus of the class will be on teaching Machine Learning concepts rather than how to use R.\n\n\nOur colleague Matt Taddy (of \nBUS 41201\n Big Data fame) lists some useful resources\nfor learning R \nhere\n.\n\n\nOther programming languages:\n\nThere are many programming languages that have readily available Machine Learning libraries.\nYou are free to use any of them in your homework and projects.\nHowever, if you opt to do so, we may not be able to provide much support.\nOne particular language with which we can offer you substantial help is \nPython\n,\nwhich has a strong Machine Learning software ecosystem with much paralellism to that of R.\nOur TA \nVinh\n is your go-to pal if you want to try out Python.\n\n\nTextbooks\n\n\nThere are no required textbooks. All materials notes will be available on the class website. \n\n\nOptional textbooks:\n Books below do not cover all the material we plan to cover in the class.\nWe list both technical books and business related books.\n\n\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R\n \n\n\nGareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani\n \n\nThis book provides a great introduction to Machine Learning.\nConcepts are well explained, without too much technical details. \n\n\nPDF available online\n\n\nElements of Statistical Learning\n \n\n\nTrevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman\n \n\nThis book covers similar material to the one above, however, it provides more technical material. \n\n\nPDF available online\n\n\nMachine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective\n \n\n\nKevin Murphy\n \n\nPhD-level book, providing a encyclopedic survey of the area.\n\n\nThe following three books are very light on technical details,\nbut do talk about applying Machine Learning in the context of business applications.\n\n\nData Science for Business\n \n\n\nFoster Provost and Tom Fawcett\n \n\n\nPredictive analytics\n \n\n\nEric Siegel\n\n\nBig Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning: Value Creation for Business Leaders and Practitioners\n \n\n\nJared Dean\n\n\nOptional references on R. \nHere\n are additional resources.\n\n\nR in a Nutshell\n \n\n\nJoseph Adler\n\n\nA Beginner's Guide to R\n \n\n\nAlain Zuur, Elena N.
